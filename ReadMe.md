# 15 Days of HTML and CSS
I created this challenge to improve my HTML and CSS skills in 15 Days and I did not have any set challenges to solve before starting with this challenge so as I completed my first day challenge, I created a new challenge for the next day and as in just 15 days of coding my skills in UI/UX design improved a lot. All projects I made in this challenge are mobile responsive and some of them follow the bootstrap column-grid-style.

I did not use JavaScript though as I first wanted to have a good grasp on HTML and CSS and after that I thought of starting a new challenge on JavaScript since it has a lot to be covered.

### Requirements:
* Knowledge about basics of HTML and CSS before starting this challenge.
* Commitment to finish all challenges.
